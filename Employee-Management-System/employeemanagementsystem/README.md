
The objective of this work is to give a complete approach to personnel information management. This will be accomplished by developing and deploying an HR management system that will result in a significant shift in the way employee data is managed.
This system's objectives include the following:



1.	Design of an HR management system to meet needs such as adding and deleting employees, viewing and printing employee data, and updating employee information.
2.	Employee data is stored in a well-designed database.
3.	An easy-to-use interface that will let user interact with the system.
 

The methodology to complete this project is as follows:

1.	I explored net beans, concepts of swings and applets.

2.	For further and a deeper understanding, I even referred to some articles, books, journals, websites and news articles.

Below are the important concepts on which the work has been done and with the support of these I was able to work on my project.
NET BEANS- NetBeans is a Java-based integrated development environment (IDE). NetBeans enables the creation of applications using a set of modular software components known as modules. NetBeans is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris. It also allows other programming languages to be extended. In addition to Java programming, Third-party developers can expand NetBeans-based applications, including the NetBeans IDE.
JAVA- High-level, Object-Oriented programming language which help programmers to run their applications efficiently. JAVA is the programming language which comes into our minds when we talk about android application. By using JAVA as a programming language, programmer can develop any type of android application easily. JAVA also provides many libraries which also helps in making efficient android application. Swing is a Java GUI widget toolkit. It's part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which provides an API for creating graphical-user- interfaces for Java programmes.
 
SWING- Swing is a Java GUI widget toolkit. It's part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which provides an API for creating-graphical-user-interfaces for Java programmes. Swing was created to give a more advanced collection of graphical user interface components than the previous Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). Swing offers a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have alook &feel that is unconnected to the underlying platform, as well as a look & feel that emulates the look & feel of numerous platforms.


SQL- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a computer language that is used to manage data in a relational database management system (RDBMS) or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It's especially beneficial for dealing with structured data, or data that has relationships between entities and variables.
