# employeemanagementsystem
 Everything has been digitised in our age of ever-increasing technology. The human workforce has grown as a result of the abundance of job options. As a result, a system that can handle the data of such a vast number of people in a company is required. Because of its user-friendly design, this project makes the process of keeping records easier. The "EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" was created to address the issues that plagued the previous manual system. This programme is designed to eliminate, and in some cases, decrease, the problems that the current system has. To eliminate data entry mistakes, the software is kept as simple as possible. When inputting incorrect data, it also displays an error notice. The user doesnâ€™t require any formal expertise to operate this system. The admin will be able to add new employees to this project. Employee data may also be seen and printed by the administrator. Admins can also remove an employee and change their details.
